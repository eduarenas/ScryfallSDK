/// Scryfall provides daily exports of our card data in bulk files. Each of these files is represented as a bulk_data object via the API.
/// URLs for files change their timestamp each day, and can be fetched programmatically.
///
/// * Card objects in bulk data include price information, but prices should be considered dangerously stale after 24 hours.
/// Only use bulk price information to track trends or provide a general estimate of card value.
/// Prices are not updated frequently enough to power a storefront or sales system. You consume price information at your own risk.
/// * Updates to gameplay data (such as card names, Oracle text, mana costs, etc) are much less frequent.
/// If you only need gameplay information, downloading card data once per week or right after set releases would most likely be sufficient.
/// * Every card type in every product is included, including planar cards, schemes, Vanguard cards, tokens, emblems, and funny cards.
/// Make sure youâ€™ve reviewed documentation for the Card type.
/// Bulk data is only collected once every 12 hours. You can use the card API methods to retrieve fresh objects instead.
